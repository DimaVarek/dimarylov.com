      During the summer of 2023, I enrolled in a frontend development course
      offered by{" "}
      <a className="ed-link" href="https://elevation.ac/" target="_blank">
        Elevation
      </a>
      . Throughout the program, I deepened my understanding of foundational
      concepts such as HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery, and explored advanced
      technologies like React and RestAPI. The course also introduced me to
      sophisticated tools like Material UI and guided me in implementing
      ReactRouter. This learning journey, facilitated by Elevation, not only
      enhanced my technical skills but also ignited creative inspiration,
      empowering me to design modern and interactive user interfaces.
