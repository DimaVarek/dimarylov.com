            In the esteemed natural science school No. 192 in Moscow, 
            my academic days were infused not only with the richness of 
            natural sciences but also with the captivating world of programming.

            I mastered the art of coding in languages such as C, C++, and Python, 
            enriching my experience and unraveling the mysteries of information technologies.
