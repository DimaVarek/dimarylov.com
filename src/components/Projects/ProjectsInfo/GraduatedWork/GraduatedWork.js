    description: "This project is dedicated to the pressing issue of comparing machine learning methods in predicting outcomes of professional matches in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Here, we delve into the details of various classification methods, pinpoint their challenges, and brainstorm ways to overcome them. Additionally, we discuss issues related to errors (or outliers) in data and strategies to eliminate them. Throughout the project, we conducted experiments with different approaches to data processing and classification.",
